Hang man game:
A brief explanation for how this works:
    1- the computer will choose a word at random from the word list. 
    2- the program will exclude words combined with dashes, -.
    3- define it's length and display it to the player 'user'.
    4- replace the word's letters with dashes and displays it to the user
    5- the play will have 6 lives, meaning that after 6 wrong guesses the program will
        terminate, display the word and the player loses.
    6- the player's guesses are either letters or words
    7- if the player entered an invalid guess he/she will be notified and no lives 
        will be deducted
    8- the correct guesses of the word will be shown in their places instead of the dashes
        to make it easier for the player to know what letters he/she guessed and their 
        positions in the word.
    9- both correct guesses and wrong ones will be stored in lists, so the player can keep 
        track of which letters he/she has chosen
    10- all player's letters will be changed to lower case letters to make it readible by the program
    11- if the player guessed all the letters right he/she will win.
